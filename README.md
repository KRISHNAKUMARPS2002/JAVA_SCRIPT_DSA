# JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to my JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms repository! Here, you'll find implementations of various data structures and algorithms in JavaScript.

## Contents

1. **Data Structures**
   - Linked List
   - Stack
   - Queue
   - Hash Table
   - Binary Search Tree
   - Graph
   - Heap
   - Trie
   - ...
2. **Algorithms**
   - Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, ...)
   - Searching Algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search, ...)
   - Pathfinding Algorithms (Dijkstra's Algorithm, A* Algorithm, ...)
   - Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, ...)
   - Dynamic Programming
   - Greedy Algorithms
   - ...

## Structure

- Each data structure and algorithm has its own directory.
- Inside each directory, you'll find a JavaScript file containing the implementation.
- Additionally, there may be accompanying README files or examples.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   [git clone https://github.com/your-username/js-dsa.git](https://github.com/KRISHNAKUMARPS2002/JAVA_SCRIPT_DSA.git)
